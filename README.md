rustful
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ogeon/rustful.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ogeon/rustful)

A RESTful web framework for Rust. The main purpose of rustful is to create a simple,
light and non-intrusive foundation for HTTP based applications. It is based on a stateless
structure, where response handlers are assigned to paths and HTTP methods, which naturally
allows it to run both as a single server or as multiple instances in a computer cluster.

Some of the features are:

* Generic response handlers. Just implement the Handler trait and you are done.
* Optional resource cache with lazy loading and simple cleaning of unused data.
* Some handy macros reduces risk for typos and makes life easier.
* Variables and recursive wildcards in routes.
* Minimal routing overhead.

Online documentation can be found [here](http://ogeon.github.io/rustful/doc/rustful/).

#Getting started

##Cargo.toml Entries

Add the following lines to your `Cargo.toml` file to get the main library:

```toml
[dependencies.rustful]
git = "https://github.com/Ogeon/rustful"
```

and the following lines to get all the helpful macros:

```toml
[dependencies.rustful_macros]
git = "https://github.com/Ogeon/rustful"
```

###Default Features

* `macros` - A collection of helpful macros.

##Write your server
Here is a simple example of what a simple project could look like. Visit
`http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:8080/Olivia` (if your name is
Olivia) to try it.

```rust
//Include `rustful_macros` during the plugin phase
//to be able to use `router!` and `try_send!`.
#![feature(plugin)]

#[plugin]
#[macro_use]
#[no_link]
extern crate rustful_macros;

extern crate rustful;

use std::error::Error;

use rustful::{Server, Context, Response, TreeRouter};
use rustful::Method::Get;

fn say_hello(context: Context, response: Response) {
    //Get the value of the path variable `:person`, from below.
    let person = match context.variables.get("person") {
        Some(name) => &name[],
        None => "stranger"
    };

    //Use the value of the path variable to say hello.
    try_send!(response.into_writer(), format!("Hello, {}!", person), "saying hello");
}

fn main() {
    let router = insert_routes!{
        TreeRouter::new(): {
            //Handle requests for root...
            "/" => Get: say_hello,

            //...and one level below.
            //`:person` is a path variable and it will be accessible in the handler.
            "/:person" => Get: say_hello
        }
    };

    //Build and run the server.
    let server_result = Server::new().port(8080).handlers(router).run();

    match server_result {
        Ok(_server) => {},
        Err(e) => println!("could not start server: {}", e.description())
    }
}
```
